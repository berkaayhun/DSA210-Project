# DSA210-Project
Nvidia stock prices and the adoption of AI

# Introduction
The rapid advances in AI have had a significant impact on the technology sector, especially with the widespread adoption of major language models like ChatGPT. Nvidia is also a major player in AI hardware. Therefore, I will analyze Nvidia stock prices in relation to the increasing adoption of AI technologies. Specifically, I will compare the growth in users since the launch of ChatGPT to Nvidia stock prices.
# Objective
The main objective of this project is to:

- Analyze the correlation between the adoption of AI technologies (with a focus on ChatGPT) and Nvidia stock prices.

- Study how increasing use of AI tools influences the performance of Nvidia's stock, and identify any patterns or trends.

- Compare the rise in the number of ChatGPT users with Nvidia's stock prices over time.

# Motivation
- The launch of ChatGPT marked a significant milestone in the widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI). As AI tools become more integrated into various industries, the demand for AI hardware, particularly graphics processing units (GPUs) like those produced by Nvidia, has grown substantially. Nvidia, being a key player in the AI hardware sector, has likely experienced fluctuations in its stock prices as a result of the growing interest in AI technologies.

- This project seeks to investigate the correlation between the adoption of AI, specifically ChatGPT, and the performance of Nvidia’s stock prices following the launch of ChatGPT. By analyzing how Nvidia’s stock has responded to the surge in AI usage, this study aims to provide insights into how the widespread adoption of AI influences stock market behavior, particularly for companies heavily involved in AI infrastructure. The results will help investors and industry professionals understand the potential impacts of AI advancements on Nvidia’s financial performance.


# Data

- Nvidia Stock Prices

- User numbers of ChatGPT

# Data Collection Plans


- Nvidia Stock Prices: Historical stock data will be retrieved from Kaggle
  
- User numbers of ChatGPTC: I will collect user growth data from academic papers, industry reports, and publicly available datasets. These papers will provide reliable data on how ChatGPT's user base has expanded over time.

# EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):


- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensure the datasets are complete and free of inconsistencies. This includes handling missing values, correcting outliers, and formatting the data for analysis.
- Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range to summarize the data and understand its distribution.

- Visualizations: Create visualizations such as time series plots, histograms, and scatter plots to visually explore the trends and relationships between ChatGPT user numbers and Nvidia stock prices.

- Correlation Analysis: Investigate the correlation between the two datasets to identify any initial relationships and trends between the rise of ChatGPT users and Nvidia’s stock performance.
